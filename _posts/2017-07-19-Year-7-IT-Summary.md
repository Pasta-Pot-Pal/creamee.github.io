This year IT has been really fun, but along the way. Every week I couldn't wait until tuesday’s or wednesday’s first period: IT.

My favourite lesson topic this year in IT has been Scratch, as I really enjoyed it and my project game was really good and worthy of an A-star, but I neglected to fill in the planning sheet, so I got ⅖  (I have actually finished it now). The hardest topic I have faced would have to be the blog posts on Github, as I had only tried one type of coding: Scratch. So I was totally new to this new type of coding. I would like to improve on making presentations on Prezi and breaking them down, because it is a great skill to be able to make presentations for important meetings. I would also like to try Python and Java.
