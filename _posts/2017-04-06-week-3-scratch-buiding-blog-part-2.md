  <tr>
    <td>Looking at my screen very carefully to make the Drink God look great was a really good strategy because of that it would not look boring. This was done really carefully so I could make the Snack King able to dispense different popcorn flavours without any worries because sometimes I worry about designs in my games. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much really, as I only looked around the room a few times at other people's screens for a few seconds and I didn’t daydream. So there weren’t many habits to work on, this week. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well, as I said I didn’t have any habits that I needed to work on, but I guess that I could try to create the sprites faster. I will improve my learning by trying to type and create sprites faster.</td>
