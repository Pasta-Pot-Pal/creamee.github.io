    <td>Looking back at my game for things that I had to mark to give scores. My final score was 22! Overall I felt that this project was really good and it can teach people how to code I really hope that I get to do this again in the years to come because it was fun. My favourite part was testing out other people's games because you never know if you could find a game that you really like. My favourite part of my game was the oven timer sprite because it has about 60 costumes that were fun to make.</td>

    <td>People in my class were playing random scratch games and when I looked at them I got distracted and forgot about the task in hand. That is one of many habits that I need to work on.</td>
