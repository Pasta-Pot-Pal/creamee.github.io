    <td>Testing each section for glitches and bugs to remove, was effective because it could show me what places I could look at to get new ideas.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited because I kept on looking around the room and sometimes spending 5 minutes looking at someone's screen. I really need to work on that habit.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will stay looking at my screen and not waste any time on anything but glitches and bugs. My learning will be improved because I will keep on searching for glitches and bugs until there are no more of them on my scratch project.</td>
