    <td>Well, I knew that I absolutely had to finish my game, although I was unwell and didn't finish it, I had a week and a few days (I think) to finish it. So, I immediately got down to work to finish my game (even though I started on a different game which was an anti-gravity platformer instead of my ice cream game for a few minutes) and then it was finished.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>That week nothing stopped me from finishing my game I was doing it until it was done (or if it was lunch!). So there aren’t much habits that I need to work on.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will:
Try not to be unwell [I was not sick (for extra information ask me what happened)] on a school day. 
Code my game to have extra levels.
And not stop coding even if it’s lunch (um… I might not stick to that).

And I will improve my learning by doing what I did today.</td>
