    <td>Well, I knew that I absolutely had to complete my game. Although I was unwell and didn't complete it in class, I had a week and a few days to finish it to a playable standard over half term. So, I immediately got down to work to finish my game (even though I was tempted to start on a different game which was an anti-gravity platformer instead of my ice cream game for a few minutes.) I wanted to include toppings but I realized that it was too hard so I left that feature for another day and then  after some concentrated days it was finished.</td>

    <td>Nothing stopped me from finishing my game. I was doing it until it was done (or if it was lunch!). There weren’t many habits that I needed to work on.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will:
Try not to be unwell 
Code my game to have extra levels.
And not stop coding even if it’s lunch (um… I might not stick to that).

And I will improve my learning by doing what I did today.</td>
