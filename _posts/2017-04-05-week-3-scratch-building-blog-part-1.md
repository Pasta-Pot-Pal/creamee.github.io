  <tr>
    <td>The strategy that I used was to just get to work on scratch which made lots of sprites 100% complete (including the scoop. Look inside the scoop's costumes for a surprise!). As daydreaming couldn’t get in the way of this, I got so much work done.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well, as I said, daydreaming wasn’t getting in the way, but I kept on looking at what lots of people were doing which is technically something that limited my learning. I need to work on my habit of looking around the room to see what everyone else is doing.</td>

    <td>Next time I will keep focus on what I am doing so then I can get even more done than what I did. I will improve my learning by doing what I did in this lesson.</td>
