    <td>Staying where my computer is and waiting for people to come round would be effective, because I can quickly ask them a question without wasting time and vital energy.</td>

    <td>Trying to find out where a PDF file editor add-on is limited my learning, and trying to find out how to use it. My habit of daydreaming in class about video games is definitely what I need to work on (unless if that's what the work is!).</td>

    <td>I will get the PDF file I need and I will use the PDF file editor to get more points in media bingo. I will improve my learning by trying not daydream in class.</td>
