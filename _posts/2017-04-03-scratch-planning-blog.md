    <td>It helped to type what I did in my game, which at first I didn't know what to do because there were so many possibilities. So really, laying it all out made it a whole lot clearer.</td>

    <td>Not typing what I had to in my planning document (I’ve done it now!). And being too lazy to even type it.</td>
