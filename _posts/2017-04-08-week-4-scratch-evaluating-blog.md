  <tr>
    <td>Well, I looked at other people's screens (again!) and waiting for someone to finish a game so I could go on it when there are other games that were free. I might need to work on that habit a bit.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will immediately go to any game that is free and assess it with the actual sections (instead of just a score!). I will improve my learning by listening how to assess people's projects.</td>
