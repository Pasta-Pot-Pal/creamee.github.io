    <td> What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Well actually, daydreaming helped a lot because I could think of new ideas for my game and create those ideas as soon as possible. For example: (marsh) mellow corn. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As daydreaming helped, it limited my learning because I could be daydreaming about my game and then I could be daydreaming about a different thing. So I don't really need to work on any habit.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will only daydream about what I need to and I will immediately stop daydreaming, and make what I just daydreamed about. I will improve my learning by not doing any of the habits that I need to work on when I donâ€™t need to.
