In IT at school I had some homework on reviewing retro video games which you could find on the internet. Here are the 13 games I played:

Pong (1972)

6/10

It's where your sprite hits a ball on a screen and you hope it hits the goal.

Not the easiest of all games, because you don't know where the ball is going to go.

Space Invaders (1978)

10/10

Easy fun. You shoot sprites, which are space ships, to get points. The more points you get, the higher you get on the leaderboard.

Place on leaderboard: 319th place

There are places where you can hide from bullets. You can even destroy these places!

Asteroids (1979)

9/10

Easy fun

In this game you are trying to shoot asteroids from your sprite which in this game happens to be a spaceship. You can turn and move it around the screen. Every couple of minutes a UFO comes on screen and try to shoot you.

Pacman (1980)

6/10

Fun

You have to make your sprite go around a course by using the arrow keys. On the way you will be collecting pellets. Once you collect all of them you start again and

The ghosts get faster and faster every time you win.

Frogger (1981 June 5th)

Boring

3/10

It is an easy game to complete and make. It is like Crossy Road because you have to make your sprite dodge cars and your sprite jump on logs to get across water. Maybe it was challenging in 1981, but now it feels too easy.

Donkey kong (1981 July 9th)

Hard

5/10

The obstacles are hard to get past because you can't move while jumping. you also have to move up ramps which the obstacles move on so, if you go up a ladder and a obstacle comes down it you could lose a life. When you get closer to the top the enemy sprites that are barrels come down faster and in packs that split up. It came out just a month after Frogger, but is miles ahead in it technical abilities and level of difficulty.

 It must have been challenging then and it still is today.

Super Mario Bros (1981)

Fun but hard

7/10

This is a game where you have to make your sprite jump over/on enemies (or you will die) and make it to the goal. There are levels and worlds. There is a secret area in the second level where you can go to world 2, 3 or 4. This means you can get to see different levels without the pain of losing against a boss.

 This came out in the same year as Donkey Kong but I think it is even better, as the levels are different, where in games before the levels are usually the same with some different settings.

Chuckie egg (1983)

3/10

Hard and boring

You make your sprite which is a farmer climb ladders to escape the ducks and collect the eggs. Technically it is a bit like Mario, as the levels change, but you can't jump on enemies.

Tetris (1984)

9/10

Great

You turn sprites that are blocks around to fit them in places. Once you get a tetris (which is a row full of blocks) the tetris you completed disappears and the game continues. If I was to improve this I would add power ups which would help get rid of blocks or make new things happen.

Arkanoid (1986)

8/10

Fun

This is a game which is like a single player version of pong. You hit a ball in a direction so you can hit bricks. You can get power ups that can help you.

Sonic (1991)

Very fun 

10/10

In this game you have 6 levels two of which are bosses. The high speed of your character is an aspect of the game which can be cruel way to lose a life because when you are running you might not know what's coming up. This surprise could be spikes or an enemy or something else.

Snake (1997)

5/10

Easy but boring 

You move a snake around the stage while you make it eat some food. Basically an endless game

I am very disappointed with this game considering better games like Sonic came out six years before it had come out.

Snoopy tennis (2001)

5/10

Hard

In this game you hit a ball to your opponent if you are lucky they will miss it and you get some points.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/wdCYnIMe3dyHetTB55h1Q_img_12.png)

  Overall the game that I think is the best is Space Invaders, because you can get points and you can shoot space ships. From this one piece of homework I discovered lots of games that I had not tried before.
