    <td> What strategies were effective? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Typing what sprites I made in my game where you make ice creams for characters, I came up with this game when I was eating ice cream was really effective. Also using the smallest pixels on scratch to make the sprites was quite effective. I planned to make the characters on scratch myself so I could change them to my liking.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by daydreaming (again!) if I didn't do this I could've finished my game quicker and add in a shop even though it took ages to make the sprites. I need to work on my habit of daydreaming a lot.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will remind myself not to get distracted and start daydreaming or then I wonâ€™t get as much done. I will improve by reminding myself what to do in the lesson if I am daydreaming.</td>
