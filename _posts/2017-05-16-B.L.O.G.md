    <td>Thinking about what the good and bad things about media was what we had to do. After watching people eating gum and doing things that are probably not possible (false advertising), I thought this would be a piece of cake. At the end of the lesson I knew all the good and bad things about twitter due to watching the twitter musical [It was very creepy and it has not made me go on twitter because then I would be a twit(heh, see what I did there? Twit. Twitter. Take of the -er. Gedit? No? Ok then)].</td>
